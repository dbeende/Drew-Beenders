My Name is Drew Beenders, a senior graphic design student who plans on graduating in May. I am new to website design as this is my first ATK class I have ever taken. I have however had the luxury to get to experiment with adobe XD last year in GD3 class. I look forward to learning the core basics of web design to broaden my overall knowledge of the user experience side of graphics.
